## 🎓What I Learned

Through building this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

### HTML Concepts
- Semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`)
- Creating multi-page websites with proper linking
- Structuring content with lists, paragraphs, and headings
- Using meta tags for viewport and charset
- Working with images and alternative text

### CSS Concepts
- Universal selector (`*`) for global styles
- Class-based styling and organization
- Box model (margin, padding, border)
- Flexbox for layouts
- Hover effects and transitions
- Color schemes and typography
- Inline-block display for product cards
- Transform property for interactive elements

### Web Development Best Practices
- File organization and folder structure
- Linking external stylesheets
- Creating consistent navigation across pages
- Naming conventions for files and classes
- Version control with Git and GitHub

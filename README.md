- Class-based styling and organization
- Box model (margin, padding, border)
- Flexbox for layouts
- Hover effects and transitions
- Color schemes and typography
- Inline-block display for product cards
- Transform property for interactive elements

### Web Development Best Practices
- File organization and folder structure
- Linking external stylesheets
- Creating consistent navigation across pages
